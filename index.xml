The way I see it, this is a function in which the final result is computed at different time:
// Example from the Functional Programming with Kotlin book fun &amp;lt;A, B, C&amp;gt; partial1(a: A, f: (A, B) -&amp;gt; C): (B) -&amp;gt; C = { b -&amp;gt; f(a, b) } In this case, we call a function passing in as arguments a a:A value and a function from (A, B) to C, producing another function from B to C.</description></item><item><title>The Downsides of Excessive Mocks and Stubs in Unit Testing</title><link>https://www.brunohensel.dev/posts/down-sides-of-mocks-and-stubs/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Aug 2023 08:09:57 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.brunohensel.dev/posts/down-sides-of-mocks-and-stubs/</guid><description>The Downsides of Excessive Mocks and Stubs in Unit Testing Link to heading As commonly known, unit testing is a crucial part of software development. The use of mocks and stubs has become standard practice to isolate components and ensure reliable tests (London School). However, it&amp;rsquo;s imperative to recognize the fragility and potential pitfalls associated with excessive mock and stub usage.
Clarifying Mocks and Stubs: Link to heading Before delving into the drawbacks, let&amp;rsquo;s clarify the terms &amp;ldquo;mock&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;stub.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://www.brunohensel.dev/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.brunohensel.dev/about/</guid><description>Android software engineer with 4+ years of experience.
